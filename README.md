# readme-file-generator

## Description

For my 9th challenge in the coding boot camp, I was to create a professional README file generator. The README file consists of sections like a title, table of contents, description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, test instructions, contact info for questions, and a license. For the license you are given three choices to choose from: The Unlicensed, MIT License, or a GNU GPLv3 License. Since the description of the GNU GPLv3 License is very lengthy; I added functionality for it to be able to collapse and expand on the users wish when viewing in the README file in GitHub. Then, based on whatever license you chose, a badge indicating what kind of license the application is protected by is displayed above the title. If you chose The Unlicensed, then no badge is shown.
