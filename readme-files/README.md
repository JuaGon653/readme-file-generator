  ## Description
  
  For my 9th challenge in the coding boot camp, I was to create a professional README file generator. The README file consists of sections like a title, table of contents, description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, test instructions, contact info for questions, and a license. For the license you are given three choices to choose from: The Unlicensed, MIT License, or a GNU GPLv3 License. Since the description of the GNU GPLv3 License is very lengthy; I added functionality for it to be able to collapse and expand on the users wish when viewing in the README file in GitHub. Then, based on whatever license you chose, a badge indicating what kind of license the application is protected by is displayed above the title. If you chose The Unlicensed, then no badge is shown.
  
  
  
  ## Installation
  
  To install the application you would need to clone this repository into your local system and run 'node index.js' in the file's integrated terminal.
  
  ## Usage
  
  The purpose of this application is to be able to effortlessly create a professionally generated README file through the command line/terminal.
  
  ## Contribute
  
  In order to contribute to this app, please send me an email stating the change you want to implement and I will get back to you shortly.
  
  ## Tests
  
  No tests at this point of time.
